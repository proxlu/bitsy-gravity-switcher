# Bitsy Gravity Switcher

## Overview

The **Bitsy Gravity Switcher** is a custom extension for the Bitsy game engine, designed to add dynamic gravity mechanics to your Bitsy games. With this system, you can create levels where the player can switch gravity, allowing them to walk on both the floor and the ceiling.

## Features

- **Gravity Mechanics**: Classic platformer gameplay with the ability to switch gravity.
- **Collision Detection**: Automatic collision handling between the player and platforms.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust gravity strength, jump height, and other parameters.
- **Gravity Swap**: Toggle gravity to make the player stick to the ceiling instead of the floor.

## How to Use

### Installation

1. Download the system script.
2. Import it into your Bitsy game.
3. Configure settings in the script.
4. Test your game to ensure the gravity mechanics work.

### Gravity and Gravity Swap

- **Gravity**: The system includes a gravity setting that pulls the player downward. You can adjust the gravity value in the script to change how quickly the player falls.
- **Gravity Swap**: The system allows you to toggle gravity, making the player stick to the ceiling instead of the floor. This can be triggered by specific tiles, objects, or events in your game.

### Basic Usage

1. Create platform levels using Bitsy's tile editor.
2. Place the player sprite in the starting room.
3. Add platforms, walls, and other objects.
4. Play and enjoy your gravity-switching game!
